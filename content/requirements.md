# Requirements Analysis Document

**GIS 441 Fall 2016  
Dr. Sergio Rey**

## Purpose
The *requirements analysis document* (RAD) provides the documentation of the formal requirements for your course project. Its purpose is to provide a complete description of your projects functionality so as to serve as a formal contract between the customer (user of your package) and the developer (you). In crafting your requirements document you should keep the intended user of your package in mind and utilize language that is common to their problem domain.


## Audience

The audience for the RAD consists of the end-user of the package, as well as the developers, and the course instructor.

## Drafting

We will dedicate two sessions in class to develop your RAD. In the first we introduce the concept of the RAD and discuss its content. The second session focuses on drafting the RAD. You will complete your RAD outside of the second class meeting and submit via a pull request.

## Template

The following outline is suggested for your RAD:

```
1. Introduction
	1. Purpose of your package
	2. Scope of your package
	3. Objectives and success metrics for your project
	4. Definitions, terms
	5. References
	6. Overview
2. Current System
	1. Description of existing project you are enhancing
	2. How will you project extend existing work
	3. What tasks does the new system support
3. System Proposal
	1. Overview
	2. Functional Requirements
		1. Listing of features to be implemented
		2. Mock-ups (sketches) of features
	3. Nonfunctional Requirements
		1. Useability
		2. Reliability
		3. Performance
		4. Supportability
		5. Implementation
		6. Interface
		7. Packaging
		8. Licensing
4. Project Management
	1. Schedule
		1. Detailed milestones for project
	2. Repositories
		1. URL for project repository
```

## Deadline

Your final requirements analysis document must be submitted as a README.md file in the `requirements` directory of your github repos for the project. You will update the course file [projects.md](projects.md) to add a link to your final RAD document via a pull requrest to the course repose. **Your pull request needs to be submitted by 9 A.M. On October 20, 2016**.
